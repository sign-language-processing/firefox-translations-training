# Collects chunked translation data of the form "file.N.out" where N is a number.
# The datasets are chunked earlier in the pipeline by split-{corpus,mono}.sh so that
# tasks can work on smaller sets of data to better parallelize the work. After processing,
# any chunked data is reassembled with this script.
#
# Example tasks running on chunked data (before this script):
#   extract-best-en-ca-1/10
#   translate-corpus-en-ca-1/10
#   translate-mono-src-en-ca-1/10
#   translate-mono-trg-en-ca-1/10
#
# Kinds:
#   taskcluster/ci/collect-mono-trg/kind.yml
#   taskcluster/ci/collect-mono-src/kind.yml
#   taskcluster/ci/collect-corpus/kind.yml
#
# Example usage:
#
#   pipeline/translate/collect.sh    \
#      fetches                       \
#      artifacts/mono.en.zst         \
